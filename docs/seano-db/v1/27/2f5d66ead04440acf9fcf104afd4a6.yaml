  - "``seano ghost`` can now ghost individual notes at a time"

employee-technical-loc-rst:
  en-US: |
    ``seano ghost`` has been taught how to ghost individual notes at a
    time, rather than always ghosting all notes from a given extern ID.  The
    given note is a fuzzy search, just like ``seano edit`` supports.

    Example::

        seano ghost HEAD

    *Ghost all notes created in the current Git commit.*

    To implement this change, the ``--extern-id`` parameter is no longer
    mandatory â€” and, it's also now an accumulator (you can use it zero or more
    times).  Any parameter that is not preceeded by ``--extern-id`` is assumed
    to be a fuzzy search.  The final set of notes to be ghosted is the union
    of all sets notes identfied by each of the parameters.
