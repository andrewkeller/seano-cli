    Seano uses Git history to identify when a note was first added.  This can
    involve following renames in some cases.  A bug was found where rename
    detection did not work at all on Windows, due to mismanagement of
    platform-specific directory separators.

    The bug has been fixed.

    The fix resulted in a unit test failure.  Curiously, the test failure
    **_matched_** some `TODO`'s in the failing test.  Even more curiously, when
    updating the test to work like the `TODO`'s said it should, the test started
    passing.  Most likely, past me knew there was a bug, but couldn't find it,
    so left some `TODO`'s behind in the tests.

    Consequently, although the original purpose of this change was to fix note
    rename detection on Windows due to a mismanagement of backslashes, this
    change inadvertently improved note rename detection on all platforms.
