  - Change default markup language in `seano` notes to Markdown

employee-technical-loc-md:
  en-US: |
    Usability testing indicated that developers want Markdown support enough
    that they're willing to manually switch back to reStructuredText on a
    per-section basis for now if they need syntax highlighted code blocks or
    Mermaid diagrams.

    Thus, the default markup type in new `seano` notes is now Markdown.

    Just like before, projects may customize the `seano` note template.

    To adopt this change, some projects may need to adjust their `seano` note
    template substitutions.  To quickly check to see if your project may be
    affected, search `docs/seano-db/seano-config.yaml` in your project for the
    text `-rst`.  To test your project's `seano` note template without creating
    a new `seano` note repeatedly, use `seano print-note-template`.

    All impact is within `seano new`.  If developers don't complain,
    then we're good to go.
