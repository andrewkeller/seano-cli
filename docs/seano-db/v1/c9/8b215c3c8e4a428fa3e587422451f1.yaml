  - Polish Android support on Windows in Zarf

employee-technical-loc-rst:

    CI has been updated to build our 3 Android slices on Ubuntu, Windows, and
    macOS builders, to prove that our Android support generally works on those
    platforms.

    Getting it to work on Windows took some minor changes, hence this note.
    In particular:

    #.  The logic that unzips the Android NDK was updated to not print thousands
        of lines of text to the console.

    #.  The logic that invokes ``seano`` in Zarf was updated to reference the
        ``python`` executable via ``sys.executable`` rather than ``"python"``,
        to workaround an issue where the nested invocation of Python escaped
        the virtual environment, losing all of the installed modules.

        Excerpt from https://bugs.python.org/issue42041:

            This is due to how Windows resolves relative paths when creating a
            new process.  It *always* looks in the current application directory
            first, which with this setup will be the original Python executable
            rather than the venv redirector.

        In theory, this problem is limited to any invocation of X from within X
        (for example, invoking Python from within Python).  I briefly searched
        for any other direct invocations of Python in Zarf, and did find some
        other possible risk areas, but they are all in old parts of Zarf that
        are due for a rewrite anyways (Python unit test infrastructure, for
        example).

    #.  A new style of writing cross-platform shell scripts in GHA has been
        imported from Snowball, in preparation for turning on CI on Windows.

# Nothing to tell MC

    Nothing to test (only Linux is impacted)
