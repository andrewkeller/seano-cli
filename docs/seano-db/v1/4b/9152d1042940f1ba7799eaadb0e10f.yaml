 - Automatically re-import extern `seano` notes if they become corrupt locally

employee-technical-loc-md:
  en-US: |
    Previously, if a local copy of an extern `seano` note was corrupt, all future
    attempts to import extern notes would fail.  To fix this problem, a
    developer had to manually delete the local copy of the extern `seano` note,
    and re-import extern notes (such as by running `waf configure`).

    Going forward, when this problem happens, the note is automatically
    re-imported from its original source, overwriting the corrupt copy, as part
    of a normal `seano` note import.  No additional manual intervention is
    required.

    If the build passes, then we're good to go!
