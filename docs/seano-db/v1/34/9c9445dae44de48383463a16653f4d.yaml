  - Include extern IDs on imported notes when performing a `seano` query

employee-technical-loc-md:
  en-US: |
    To aid in making improvements to `seano` views, when you run a query, all
    imported notes now contain a property indicating the extern ID of the
    database from which the note originated.  The new property is named
    `x-seano-extern-identifier`.  It does not exist on non-imported notes.

    This change is classified as low risk because it does not impact any
    production-facing functionality.

    Docs are not used in production, so there is nothing customer-facing to test
    here.
